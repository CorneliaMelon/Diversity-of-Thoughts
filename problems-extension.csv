"The equation $a^7xy-a^6y-a^5x=a^4(b^4-1)$ is equivalent to the equation $(a^mx-a^n)(a^py-a^2)=a^4b^4$ for some integers $m$, $n$, and $p$.  Find $mnp$."
"Mary can mow a lawn in four hours and Tom can mow the lawn in 5 hours. If Tom works for 2 hours alone, what fractional part of the lawn remains to be mowed?"
"If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers less than $20$ for which $x + y + xy = 76$, what is the value of $x + y$?"
"The sum of the first four terms of an arithmetic sequence is $10$. If the fifth term is $5$, what is the sixth term?"

"Let \[f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2-1 & \text{ if }n < 4,
\\ 3n-2 & \text{ if }n \geq 4.
\end{cases}
\]Find $f(f(f(2)))$."
"The integers $G$ and $H$ are chosen such that
\[\frac{G}{x+5}+\frac{H}{x^2-4x}=\frac{x^2-2x+10}{x^3+x^2-20x}\]for all real values of $x$ except $-5$, $0$, and $4$. Find $H/G$."
"Let $C$ be the circle with equation $x^2+12y+57=-y^2-10x$. If $(a,b)$ is the center of $C$ and $r$ is its radius, what is the value of $a+b+r$?"
"My friend and I both have the same math homework one day. I work at a rate of $p$ problems per hour and it takes me $t$ hours to finish my homework. My friend works at a rate of $2p-4$ problems per hour and it only takes him $t-2$ hours to finish his homework. Given that $p$ and $t$ are positive whole numbers and I do more than $10$ problems per hour, how many problems did I do?"
"If $23=x^4+\frac{1}{x^4}$, then what is the value of $x^2+\frac{1}{x^2}$?"
"The 2007 AMC 10 will be scored by awarding $6$ points for each correct response, $0$ points for each incorrect response, and $1.5$ points for each problem left unanswered. After looking over the $25$ problems, Sarah has decided to attempt the first $22$ and leave only the last $3$ unanswered.

How many of the first $22$ problems must she solve correctly in order to score at least $100$ points?"
"How many cubic feet are in one cubic yard? One yard is equal to three feet.
